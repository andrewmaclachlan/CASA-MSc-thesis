# Figures, tables, hosting GitBook

This section is going to focus including figures and creating tables

```{r methodsflow, echo=FALSE, out.width="300pt", fig.cap="Summary of methdological procedure for (a).... and (b)...."}
library(here)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('general_images','example_flow.png'))
```
## Including figures and tables

### Figures

To include the figure above use the code:

`knitr::include_graphics(here::here('general_images','example_flow.png'))` 

within a code chunk. In the chunk options you can specify the width and figure captions e.g. 

`out.width="100pt", fig.cap="Summary of methdological procedure for (a).... and (b)...."`. 

However, if you do show the code with `echo=TRUE` then you can't specify the `out.width`. 

For making flow diagrams have a look at:

1. Lucidchart
1. Draw.io

### Tables

For creating tables i'd suggest creating either an excel file or `.csv` and then reading the data into R and using the `kabble` package to format it how you wish. The example below is from the abbreviations section


```{r tableexample, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(readxl)
library(fs)
library(here)

#read in data
read_excel(here("tables", "abbreviations.xlsx"))%>%
  arrange(Term) %>% # i.e. alphabetical order by Term
  # booktab = T gives us a pretty APA-ish table
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE)%>% 
  kable_styling(position = "center")%>%
  # any specifc row changes you want
    row_spec(.,
  row=0,
  bold = TRUE)
```

You do loads of things with kabble including adding small visulisations within the table - [consult the documentation for more info](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html#Overview).

**If in doubt, keep it simple**

other useful arguments for tables:

* `column_spec(2, width = "9cm")` = set column width

* `kable(timeline,longtable = T....`= allow the table to go over multiple pages

For example...
\newpage
```{r kable, echo=TRUE}
read_excel(here("tables", "policy.xlsx"))%>%
  mutate_all(~ replace_na(.x, "")) %>%
  # booktab = T gives us a pretty APA-ish table
  knitr::kable("latex", longtable = T, booktabs = T, 
               caption = 'Relevant influential international, metropolitan and local UHI and urban expansion policies, strategies and assessments (with publication date) referred to in this paper. * Denotes documents that lack specific UHI related policy but recognise the value of maintaining vegetation.')%>% 
  kable_styling(position = "center", full_width = T)%>%
  # any specifc row changes you want
    row_spec(.,
  row=c(0,1,8, 18),
  bold = TRUE)%>%
  column_spec(1, width = "14cm")%>%
  row_spec(c(1, 8, 18), hline_after = T)
```

**Note** if you see the caption in the `.pdf` version it goes off the side of the page --- this is the reason why you don't show code in a `.pdf`. If you ever had to you could just seperate the string into sections and at the start use `paste("hello","this","is","a","string", sep=" ")`

Now remember to cross reference this table, it would be...Table `\@ref(tab:kable)`, giving Table \@ref(tab:kable)

## Hosting the book

You will need to create a new GitHub repository to host your book online using GitHub pages --- like the example is. GitHub pages takes a load of `.html` files and makes a website. 

To do so you need to set up a few things

1. Go to the `_bookdown.yml` file and make sue that that you have this line of code: `output_dir: docs` (it should be there)
1. In the same file make sure your `book_filename` doesn't have any spaces use `-` or `_` e.g. `CASA-Thesis`
1. Build your book locally, close the preview window
1. Save, stage changes, commit and then push to GitHub
1. On your GitHub repository > settings > GitHub pages > select the source as main and the folder as docs
1. Make sure you build your `.pdf` and then your `gitbook` for the latest `.pdf` to be a download option on the website.
